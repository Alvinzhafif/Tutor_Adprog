### Reflection 1 / Exercise 1 
<hr>

For exercise 1 i have implemented clean code architecture which is by implementing variables that implies to their meaning and purpose.
i also implemented Git flow by splitting the development into two seperate branch(main and list-product branch) this two branch help me to be more organized.

Another implementation i did was secure coding by making sure the output of the data in forms to not be filled irrationally. Improvements are still necessary to be made in the coming future, as currently there's no authentication nor authorization for the project 
this will be a great addition to the secure coding implementation.
