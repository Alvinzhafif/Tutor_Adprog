### Reflection 1 / Exercise 1 
<hr>

For exercise 1 i have implemented clean code architecture which is by implementing variables that implies to their meaning and purpose.
i also implemented Git flow by splitting the development into two seperate branch(main and list-product branch) this two branch help me to be more organized. 
<br>
<br>
Another implementation i did was secure coding by making sure the output of the data in forms to not be filled irrationally. Improvements are still necessary to be made in the coming future, as currently there's no authentication nor authorization for the project 
this will be a great addition to the secure coding implementation. In addition, further personal reminder to use git flow is needed for retrospection. Because currently, i am still in habbit of using a single branch which is main as the main branch for creating both the edit and delete function of the product list page

### Reflection 2 / Exercise 2

1. After implementing unit tests, I feel relieved and proud to see my code working smoothly for all the features of creating the product, editing them, and also deleting them. The number of unit tests for a class may vary in my opinion depending on how much features does the class have.
But, it should come to mind that the number of tests for the class should cover the majority of the crucial features that will often be used. By checking the crucial aspects it will further reassure that your codes will run as intended without any hindrance.

2. If a new and additional test for checking number of items in the product list were to be added, it will surely increase the assurance and confirmation of your code is working smoothly. However, there is also a chance that it will reduce the code's cleanliness. Such as code duplication, creating another test case can lead to similar setups to other test cases. To reduce the chance of code duplication, a further enforcement and guidance to reuse codes by refactoring them time to time will be needed. Another example of reduction can be Inconsistent Naming. With the increase of cases additional naming of variables might be needed, and as those increases so as well the chance of creating Variable names that is not consistent or perhaps unreadable. A good way to reduce this is to reuse Variable names that already exist and add new ones if their functions does not exist yet while keeping clear functionality towards their name.
